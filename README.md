# LIBSELF - LIghtning Based SElf-supervised Learning Framework

## Introduction

This is a PyTorch Lightning based framework to run experiments for self-supervised learning tasks. We borrow structure and some code from SSLIME framework (mentioned in references) but use PyTorch Lightning's experiment pipeline to reduce boilerplate code and enable easier logging and multi-GPU, multi-node and mixed precision training.

## Getting Started
